# Lunar Lander AI 

This repository contains the implementation of a PPO agent to solve the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gymnasium.

## Introduction

The Lunar Lander environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to safely land a spacecraft on the moon's surface. In this project, we use PPO to train an agent to learn optimal actions for successful landings.

 ## Requirements


+ Python 3.7+
+ OpenAI Gymnasium
+ Stable-Baselines3 
+ Other libraries
 ## Usage 
1. Open `Lunar lander project.ipynb` using Jupyter.
2. Run the notebook cells to train the PPO agent and observe its performance.




## Results

The trained agent demonstrates successful landings in the Lunar Lander environment. You can view a `video` of the agent's performance in the videos directory.
